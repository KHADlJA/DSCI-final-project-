    "Dry beans, scientifically known as Phaseolus vulgaris L., come in different varieties and are an important crop produced globally (Beebe et al., 2013). Cultivating mixed bean species rather than a single variety is common in Turkish agriculture, as well as in other Asian countries. This results in economic losses, as it is more difficult to process and sell mixed bean types. Turkey has several varieties of dry beans, including Barbunya, Battal, Bombay, Calı, Dermason, Horoz, Tombul, Selanik, and Seker. However, the market value of dry beans depends on the specific type of bean, and some beans are sold for higher prices than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cultivation of the seven different beans together makes sorting them a crucial task (Koklu & Ozkan, 2020). Rather than selling them as a mixed batch, farmers can make more profit by sorting them by bean type. Manual classification of bean seeds can be error-prone and time-consuming, especially when dealing with high production volumes. Manual sorting is also expsensive and inconsistent concerning accuracy, which has led to growing interest in automatic sorting systems. Computer algorithms can analyze images of seeds and classify them based on features like size and shape, making sorting efficient and less labor-intensive than manual sorting.  A seed classification system would assist farmers in obtaining uniform seed varieties from crop production while reducing the time and error of manual sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are interested in seed classification within the context of our [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dry+bean+dataset), which identifies the seven different types of dry beans cultivated in Turkey based on the market situation and their physical features according to the Turkish Standards Institution. This research uses images of seven varieties of dry beans generated by a computer vision system, examining 16 features of the grains (Koklu & Ozkan, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this project is to create a k-NN classifier that can classify dry bean seeds uniformly and accurately, using the dataset from this study."

Moreover, the graph indicates that the estimated accuracy remains relatively stable even if we slightly increase or decrease k around the value of 13.

    "As seen in the above data analysis, the KNN classifier has an accuracy of about 91% in classifying seven different classes of seed which are 'SEKER', 'BARBUNYA', 'BOMBAY', 'CALI', 'HOROZ', 'SIRA', and 'DERMASON'. The confusion matrix and heatmap represent the summarisation of the predicted results (Figure 4 and 5), which is a significant tool for evaluating the accuracy of our classifier model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above heatmap, Figure 5, gives a visual representation of the data analysis and accuracy of the model. The overall accuarcy of the model is sufficicent for our purposes as it predicts about 91% correct observations. Notably, there were some seed types that were misclassified. The diagonal of the heatmap depicts the correct predictions made by the model. We can draw a few conclusions from the heatmap, which represents misclassified seeds (lower counts) with red colour, while it depicts high misclassfication with orange. By observing the heatmap we find that about 120 DERMASON seeds were identified SIRA (as it has an orange colour) and about 45 DERMASON seeds were identified SEKER (light orange). Also, about 122 SIRA seeds were identified DERMASON and therefore, having orange colour for depiction.This suggests that there might some physical similarities between DERMASON and SIRA seeds. In addition to this about 21 CALI seeds were misclassified as BARBUNYA and about 74 BARBUNYA seeds were misclassified as CALI. This suggests that there may be some overlap in the features of these two types of seeds, making it challenging for the classifier to differentiate between them accurately.\n"

    "Based on the dataset, we did not expect the classification model to achieve a 91% accuracy. The dataset contained 16 different variables, which could be used as predictors in the classification model. The higher number of predictors in a model often corresponds to less accuracy. Other than this the target variable of the dataset which is the CLASS has seven different types of seed. We saw this as a potential reason to decrease the accuracy of the model as the class 'BOMBAY' had about 3.84% observations in the dataset while the class 'DERMASOn' had about 26.1% observations in the dataset. This makes the data close to an imbalanced dataset and might make the model biassed towards one type.Other than this the seven different types of seed types increases the complexity and makes it challenging for the model to predict accurate seed type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 91% accuracy classifier can be considered good in some contexts, but it may not be sufficient in others. It ultimately depends on the user's needs and expectations. For our specific classifer, it had difficulty distinguishing between Dermason and Sira beans, which have different market values. Dermason beans are currently around 10 dollars per kg, while Sira beans 6 dollars per kg. This means that misclassifying a significant amount of beans can result in a big difference in profit for farmers. For example, misclassifying 1000 kg of Dermason beans as Sira beans would result in a loss of 4000 dollars. Similarly, misclassifying Barbunya beans as Cali beans could also result in substantial losses for farmers, given the large price difference between them. Barbunya beans are around 27 dollars per kg, while Cali beans (also known as Cannellini beans) are around 10 dollars per kg. Misclassifying 1000 kg of Barbunya beans as Cali beans would result in a loss of 17,000 dollars. As such, farmers may have different expectations for their classifier's accuracy. Some may think a 91% accuracy is acceptable, while others may not. If a farmer believes that a 9% error rate is too high and will result in significant losses, they may consider the classifier insufficient. However, if a farmer believes that 91% accuracy is acceptable, they may use the classifier. Therefore, the effectiveness of a classifier is subjective to the user and their need for profit. A 91% accuracy rate may be good enough for some, but not for others.\n",

    "The selection of the optimal seed species is a crucial issue for bean farmers and the market alike. With a wide range of genotypes cultivated across the globe, it is imperative to differentiate the finest seed variety from the mixed dry bean population. If this is not done, the market value of these heterogeneous bean species may witness a significant decline, as pointed out by Varankaya and Ceyhan (2012). Findings from this study have significant implications for the agricultural industry, as development of automated image classification technology can improve efficiency and accuracy of dry bean sorting, reducing labor costs. Success could lead to research on applications of image classification models to other agricultural products (e.g., crops and fruits), or examining socio-economic impacts of this technology via agriculture, specifically potential for job displacement.\n",

    "4. discuss what future questions could this lead to?  \n",
    "It may be worth finding a method to prevent misclassification of Dermason seeds as Sira. One question that arises is if there are other features of these beans that could be added to the dataset to improve the accuracy of the model. We could also examine the extent to which this specific misclassification affects the quality and economic value of the final product. Taking these factors into consideration will help us answer the question of whether our classifier's accuracy is truly useful for the purpose of farming uniform seeds, or if it must be improved to make even more accurate predictions."
